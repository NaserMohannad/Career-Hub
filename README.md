This repository documents a production-ready multi-agent pipeline I built with CrewAI to source, scrape, and rank student and entry-level opportunities, then deliver them to learners via n8n and email. I designed and coded all tools, prompts, and server endpoints, and deployed the stack with a Dockerfile on Hugging Face Spaces.
